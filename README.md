All you need to do is fill out the "Managers" and "Players" lists at the top for your league.
The "Managers" list includes the names of the individuals in your league. 
The "Players" list includes the players on each of the managers' teams. 
Please fill out the "Players" list in the order you put the managers in the "Managers" list. For example, Christian's team has Allen Robinson.
Once done filling those out, hit "Runtime" and then "Run All".
